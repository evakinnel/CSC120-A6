- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

It is helpful. It keeps things very organized and allows me to focus completely on one thing at a time.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think this helped me understand ingeritance better, but I would still feel nervous about creating my own tree. Following the instructions and doing what made sense to me was honestly what was working. And when I was getting an error with the Hashtable and couldn't figure out why, I focused on doing as much as I could to prepare for when I do figure out what was wrong, and I sacrificed 2 points for now. I definately recommend not always pushing through to get every single point because I know I'll be able to try again later when my brain is fresher and knows more.
